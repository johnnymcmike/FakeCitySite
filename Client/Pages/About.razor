<h2>How It's Made</h2>
<h4>What Frameworks?</h4>
This site was made as a learning project in my free time. It uses MudBlazor, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework in order
to use purely C# for the entire stack, as that's my favorite language and I'm not that good at Javascript yet.
Someday I might rewrite it in React, as Blazor is kind of huge and bandwidth isn't free.
<h4>Where's The Data From?</h4>
I actually didn't use an API or anything to get the cities. Me and my friends typed them all out manually in a Discord channel,
using specific formatting, which I then downloaded as a .txt and scraped into the database. As such, there might be quirks or inaccuracies: all of the cities with "(Unspecified)" as the country are where we forgot to put that in our message.
I also don't store any specific location data for the cities, so the Google Map you see is just querying by the city name
and its country. This can lead to some funny bugs where cities like "Pasta, Greece" show up as the closest greek restaurant to you, but it's not that big of a deal, so I'm planning on keeping it like this for now.
<h4>Hosting</h4>
Hosted on DigitalOcean. I think it's a pretty good value overall. If you're considering building something similar to this, use my referral link below if you want $100 in credit for 60 days. If you end up sticking with them and actually spending money, it will also help pay for my hosting! :)
<h2>Feedback</h2>
If you know that one of my cities is wrong, or you have any other suggestions or bugs to report, just email me at <a href="mailto:nihj2dx63@mozmail.com">nihj2dx63@mozmail.com</a>. Thanks :)

Like I said, bandwidth isn't free! It's not costing me anything just yet, but help me out preemptively here.<br/><br/>
