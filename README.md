Source code for the [Impostown](https://impostown.net) city-guessing game. Uses Blazor, ASP.NET Core, and EF Core to accomplish a full-stack C#-only webapp. Uses SQLite for the backend database, so this won't work without a properly-configured Cities.db file in the server directory, but the database system you use doesn't super matter. Feel free to use this as a template to develop your own similar games, so long as you respect the license. Enjoy :) File an issue if you have questions/bugs
